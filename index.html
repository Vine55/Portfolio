      <h2>About</h2>
      <p>
        I build small, focused front-end projects that explore interactivity, layout, and clean structure using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I enjoy coding for its own sake, especially the moment when logic meets user action and a static page becomes something responsive and alive. When starting a project, I prioritize clear logic and user flow, making sure each interaction has a reason and a visible result.

I’m particularly drawn to UI responses, DOM manipulation, and interactive experiments, including small games, because they make cause and effect obvious and rewarding.  Most of my work is passion-driven and built for myself, with a growing focus on expanding into backend development using Django and React.

              A browser-based avoidance game where the player continuously follows cursor movement while dodging incoming asteroids.
